# Svelte Vs React

When we come to javascript framewroks, React and Svelte are some of the names that really stick around. React being significantly more popular, but it is not always a popularity contest, is it? Let's talk business.

## React Developer

### Structure of framewroks

When I am talking about svelte, I am referring to svelte kit. Svelte kit is a really good framework. [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte-kit.com) also has a directory based router and much more.

Now on other hand, React doesn't really have a standared way building react apps. But I will use [NextJS](https://nextjs.dev) as an example. NextJs is a exeptionally good framework for making react apps, it too has a directory based navigation, and much more features

### Popularity

While, I will say that popularity is not the best point of an application it is a factor, using react has the advantage for finding jobs more quickly and also you could find more engineers to hire if you're using React. Unfortunately Popularity is big thing for the decision.

### Implementation of Code

In react ðŸ‘‡

```jsx
fucntion Component() {

  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  // useEffect for lifecycle events
  useEffect(() => { // Requires a deep understanding of react
    function async getData() { // No direct async function support
      return fetch();
    }
    setData(getData());
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? data.title : "Sample"}
  </div>
  );
}

```

In svelte ðŸ‘‡

```svelte
<script>
  let data = null;
  <!-- More readable code -->
  onMount(async() => { // accepts async function
    data = fetch();
  })
</script>

<div>
  {#if data}
    {data.title}
  {:else}
    {"Sample"}
  {/if}
</div>
```

As you can see from the code about A react component is a javascript function with jsx object as it's return value, while every svelte page is a component.

### Async functions and Lifesycle

In the code above, I am fething data from a database. For react, I am using the useState hook and setting the initial value to null and I added a useState hook to with the [] to only run the code once, and useEffect hook cannot take an async function so I am defining an async function and running it.

But for svelte, I am just defining a variable using the let keyword and then calling the onMount function, not is the code more readable but it can also take an async function.

### Readable code

As you saw above calling async functions and handling lifecycle of an application is more easier to do in `svelte` than in `React`. I realise that this is not a fair comparision because we are not event using svelte's await blocks to handle promices.

```svelte
{#await promice}
  <!-- Waiting for the promice -->
  <p>Waiting...</p>
{:then data}
  <!-- After getting the data -->
  {data.title}
{:catch error}
  <!-- Catching error -->
  <p>Error: {error}</p>
{/await}
```
