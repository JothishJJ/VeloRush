# Svelte Vs React

When we come to javascript framewroks, React and Svelte are some of the names that really stick around. React being significantly more popular, but it is not always a popularity contest, is it? Let's talk business.

### Structure of framewroks

When I am talking about svelte, I am referring to svelte kit. Svelte kit is a really good framework. [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte-kit.com) also has a directory based router and much more.

Now on other hand, React doesn't really have a standared way building react apps. But I will use [NextJS](https://nextjs.dev) as an example. NextJs is a exeptionally good framework for making react apps, it too has a directory based navigation, and much more features

### Popularity

While, I will say that popularity is not the best point of an application it is a factor, using react has the advantage for finding jobs more quickly and also you could find more engineers to hire if you're using React. Unfortunately Popularity is big thing for the decision.

### Implementation of Code

In react 👇

```jsx
fucntion Component() {

  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  // useEffect for lifecycle events
  useEffect(() => { // Requires a deep understanding of react
    function async getData() { // No direct async function support
      return fetch();
    }
    setData(getData());
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? data.title : "Sample"}
    </div>
  );
}

```

In svelte 👇

```svelte
<!-- More readable code -->
<script>
  let data = null;
  onMount(async() => { // accepts async function
    data = fetch();
  })
</script>

<div>
  {#if data}
    {data.title}
  {:else}
    {"Sample"}
  {/if}
</div>
```
